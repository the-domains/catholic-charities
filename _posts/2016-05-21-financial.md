Helping hands. The   
theme of this Annual   
Report symbolizes the   
work we do every day at   
Catholic Charities.   
Since beginning my   
journey as Executive Director in May 2014, I have   
had the pleasure of shaking so many hands, from   
staff and volunteers to donors and those in need.   
Each hand held a story. I shook many of them on   
cold winter mornings at our Homeless Services   
Center outreach, offering hot coffee and warm   
oatmeal to those who spent the night on the streets.   
"Marian" told me about her battle with addiction,   
and "Joe" regaled everyone with tales of his   
adventures during the war.   
I will never forget Henry Trione's enthusiastic hand   
clasping mine in a gesture of partnership to help   
those in desperate need. I didn't know it would be   
the last time.   
Every day I am grateful for the hands of our staff   
and volunteers reaching out to help everyone who   
comes to our doors. They are our hands, just as   
we are all God's hands, doing the work that we are   
called to do.   
There is a statue of Christ with no hands outside   
of St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church in Santa Rosa.   
The hands were "stolen" multiple times by vandals,   
so Fr. Denis O'Sullivan, pastor, said to let it be. He   
put a caption at the bottom of the statue, "We are   
His hands."   
As you read about our accomplishments in this   
report, think of the hands behind the numbers and   
the financial data -- belonging both to those we   
help and those that offer help. Our team of staff,   
volunteers, and donors together lift people out of   
poverty, aid people wanting to become citizens, and   
provide steady support to seniors dealing with the   
challenges of aging.   
It is said that "Many hands make light work." Our   
work may not be light, but the teamwork of many   
hands can move mountains, build bridges, and   
create a better world for those we serve.
