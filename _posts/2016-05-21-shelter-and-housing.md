* **Homeless Services Center**

This is a first point of contact if you are homeless or at imminent danger of becoming homeless. The center provides resources, counseling, intake for shelters, and other services for those in need. It also has showers, laundry, telephone, and mail services for your use.

* **Family Support Center**

Our 138-bed family shelter provides a warm, stable home for families coming to us from cars, tents, and crowded motel rooms. Geared to meet the needs of every family member, with a special focus on children, services include case management, employment and housing counseling, referrals for medical screenings, getting children up to grade level in school, and support services designed to move families toward self-sufficiency.
  * Coach2Career  
For those who are homeless, formerly homeless, or in need of employment assistance. Includes a seven-week certificate course teaching job readiness skills, a Learning Center computer lab, one-on-one coaching for resume writing, interviewing, proper work attire (including free outfits from our Hire Attire closet), and job referrals
  * BRIDGES and Youth Programs  
An after-school program that bridges the gap in educational needs for children living at FSC, and includes the Discovery Center, Homework Club, monthly themed activities, and field trips.

* **Samuel L. Jones Hall**

This is the largest full service shelter in northern California for individuals or couples without children. Up to 120 people daily are provided food and shelter, case management, job and housing counseling and placement, as well as referrals for medical help, and community and veterans services. This is a project of the City of Santa Rosa, the County of Sonoma, and the Community Foundation Sonoma County.

* **Safe Parking**

It is estimated that 20% of Sonoma County's 3,300 homeless live in their cars. The county Board of Supervisors opened the doors to allow these residents to sleep in their cars and authorized Catholic Charities to manage the program and provide food, bathroom facilities, warming heaters, and other services. There are now scattered Safe Parking sites at various locations around the county.

* **Nightingale**

Located at Brookwood Health Center, this is a short-term, 13-bed facility for homeless adults who have been discharged from the hospital and are in need of additional recuperation. Health services and case management are provided.

* **Rainbow House (Napa)**

Vulnerable single young mothers (ages 18 to 29), pregnant or with children, find a safe haven and structure in this 34-bed transitional housing program in Napa. They are provided counseling, ongoing case management, parenting classes, and employment services.

* **Betty Kwan Chinn Day Center (Eureka)**

For homeless individuals in Humboldt County, including many children, Catholic Charities and the Betty Kwan Chinn Foundation opened this day center to provide helpful resources, job assistance, learning life skills, and more.

* **Transitional Housing**

With a 1% apartment vacancy rate in Sonoma County, moving from shelter living into an independent home has major challenges. We are currently managing 15 units in Santa Rosa with supportive services for previously homeless families. Another 10 units are provided at DeMeo House.

* **Permanent Supportive Housing**

Many individuals and families (post-shelter or transitional housing) qualify for permanent supportive housing. Qualified, screened, and accepted applicants pay a fixed percentage of their income, and also continue their relationship with a case manager.

* **Homelessness Prevention/Rapid Re-housing**

This program is a lifeline for families and individuals to quickly resolve threatened homelessness, providing financial and other assistance to help qualified people find safe, affordable housing or to maintain their current housing and stay out of shelters.

* **Warming Stations/Cold Weather Hotline**

During inclement weather (rain, temperatures below 38 degrees) hot coffee, food, and clothing are availalbe to those in need at our Homeless Services Center at 600 Morgan Street or one of our community mobile warming stations. For locations and help call **707.800.2927\.**
